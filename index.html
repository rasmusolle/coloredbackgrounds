			<h1>Colored Desktop Backgrounds</h1>
			<p>This is a site which contains a collection of colored desktop backgrounds. Simply save the color you want as an image and set it as your desktop background.</p>
			<p>Most of these are taken from the standard <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hex.asp">HTML color names</a>.</p>
			<h3>But my OS has colored backgrounds! Why does this exist?</h3>
			<p>Congratulations! Not every OS has colored backgrounds, especially not very many. I made this especially because Chrome OS didn't have a big enough selection of colored backgrounds.</p>
